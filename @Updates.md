We can enhance the app's functionality by adding a few more pages. Here are some suggestions for additional pages that would complement the existing structure and improve the overall user experience:

1. Dashboard Page:
   A personalized homepage for users to see an overview of their recent activities, pinned notes, and quick actions.
2. Categories Management Page:
   A dedicated page for users to create, edit, and organize their note categories.
3. Trash/Archive Page:
   A page to view and manage deleted or archived notes, with options to restore or permanently delete them.
4. Collaboration Hub:
   A centralized page to view and manage all shared notes and collaborations.
5. Search Results Page:
   A dedicated page to display advanced search results with filtering options.
6. Notifications Center:
   A page to view all app notifications, invitations, and activity updates.
7. Integrations Page:
   A page to manage and set up integrations with third-party services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote).
8. Analytics Dashboard:
   A page displaying usage statistics, popular tags, and productivity insights.
9. Templates Gallery:
   A page showcasing pre-designed note templates for various purposes (e.g., meeting notes, project planning, journaling).
10. Public Notes Explorer:
    A page to discover and explore public notes shared by the community.

Would you like me to implement any of these pages or do you have a preference for which one to start with?
